## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Level 1 Heading

## Level 2 Heading

This is a test; it is only a test; had it been a real document, it
would have said something.

## Yet Another Level 2 Heading {#first-yet-another}

An R chunk
```{r}
sin(0:5)
```

### Try 2

Blah, blah, blah.  `exp(200) =` $`r exp(200)`$.
